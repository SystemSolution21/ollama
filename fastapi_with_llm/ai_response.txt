**FastAPI: A Modern, Fast (High-Performance), Web Framework for Building Web Applications**

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building web applications. It's designed to be highly scalable and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance web APIs.

**Key Features of FastAPI:**

1. **High Performance**: FastAPI is built on standard Python type hints and uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) for asynchronous HTTP requests.
2. **Fast Development**: FastAPI has a very small codebase, making it easy to learn and develop with.
3. **Automatic API Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates API documentation using OpenAPI, making it easy to document your API.
4. **Strongly Typed**: FastAPI is strongly typed, which means that you need to define the data types of your endpoints before they can be used.
5. **Supports ASGI Servers**: FastAPI supports multiple ASGI servers, including uvicorn, gunicorn, and hypercorn.

**Advantages of FastAPI:**

1. **Easy to Learn**: FastAPI has a very small codebase, making it easy to learn and use.
2. **High Performance**: FastAPI is highly scalable and can handle high traffic.
3. **Automatic API Documentation**: FastAPI generates API documentation automatically, making it easy to document your API.
4. **Strongly Typed**: FastAPI's strong typing makes it easier to catch errors at compile time.

**Disadvantages of FastAPI:**

1. **Limited Support for Traditional Web Framework Features**: FastAPI has limited support for traditional web framework features like routing and middleware.
2. **Steep Learning Curve for Advanced Features**: While FastAPI is easy to learn, its advanced features require a good understanding of Python and asynchronous programming.

**Use Cases for FastAPI:**

1. **Building High-Performance Web APIs**: FastAPI is ideal for building high-performance web APIs that need to handle large amounts of traffic.
2. **Microservices Architecture**: FastAPI can be used to build small, independent services that communicate with each other using APIs.
3. **Real-Time Data Processing**: FastAPI's strong typing and asynchronous capabilities make it well-suited for real-time data processing applications.

**Example Code:**

Here is an example of a simple "Hello World" endpoint in FastAPI:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
```
This code defines a single endpoint at `/` that returns the string `"Hello, World!"`. You can run this code using `uvicorn`, like so:
```bash
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```
And then use a tool like `curl` to test the endpoint:
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000/
{"message":"Hello, World!"}
```
