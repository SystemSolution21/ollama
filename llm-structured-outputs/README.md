This tutorial shows how to extract machine learning features from text data with structured outputs using large language models. The tech stack includes open-source AI tools such as Ollama and Meta's Llama3.2 large language model, as well as the pandas and gnews libraries.

As an example, the tutorial shows how to filter for future-looking stock sentiment from news article headlines when creating financial sentiment scores.

Structured output is still an error prone exercise as new libraries attempt to wrangle AI model output into structured formats, but if can figure out how to master it, integrate it into your machine learning workflows, and even automate the creation of ML features and datasets, will have a competitive advantage as a machine learning engineer, AI engineer, or data scientist.
