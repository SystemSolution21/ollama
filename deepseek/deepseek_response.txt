First, I observe that the given quadratic equation is \(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\).

To solve this equation, I can use factoring. I need to find two numbers that multiply to give 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the x-term).

The numbers 2 and 3 satisfy these conditions because \(2 \times 3 = 6\) and \(2 + 3 = 5\). Therefore, I can factor the quadratic as \((x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\).

Setting each factor equal to zero gives me two equations: \(x + 2 = 0\) and \(x + 3 = 0\). Solving these, I find that \(x = -2\) and \(x = -3\) are the solutions.

Thus, the roots of the equation are \(-2\) and \(-3\).

To solve the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \]

we can use **factoring**. Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Factor the Quadratic Equation
We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(6\) (the constant term) and add up to \(5\) (the coefficient of the \(x\)-term). 

The numbers \(2\) and \(3\) satisfy these conditions:
- \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
- \(2 + 3 = 5\)

So, we can factor the quadratic as:

\[ (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 \]

### Step 2: Apply the Zero Product Property
If the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore:

1. \(x + 2 = 0\)
   - Subtract \(2\) from both sides:
     \[ x = -2 \]

2. \(x + 3 = 0\)
   - Subtract \(3\) from both sides:
     \[ x = -3 \]

### Conclusion
The solutions to the equation \(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\) are:

\[
\boxed{-2,\ -3}
\]
