To solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula.

**Factoring method:**

We need to find two numbers whose product is 6 and whose sum is 5. These numbers are 3 and 2.

So, we can rewrite the equation as:

x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x + 3) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x + 3 = 0 => x = -3

x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -3 and x = -2.

**Quadratic formula method:**

If factoring doesn't work, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (-(5) ± √((5)^2 - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)

x = (-5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2

x = (-5 ± √1) / 2

x = (-5 ± 1) / 2

So, we have two possible solutions:

x = (-5 + 1) / 2 => x = -4/2 => x = -2

x = (-5 - 1) / 2 => x = -6/2 => x = -3

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -3 and x = -2.

Both methods give us the same solutions: x = -3 and x = -2.
